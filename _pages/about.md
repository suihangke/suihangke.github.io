## About Me

I am a second-year PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) (ECE) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Minh Do](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/minhdo). Before joining UIUC, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a double major in Decision Analytics from the University of Hong Kong. 

I am grateful to Prof. [Xiaoming Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NleHkdYAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Lequan YU](https://yulequan.github.io/) for introducing me to research and providing guidance during my undergraduate studies. Additionally, I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Justin Wan](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jwlwan/) at the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo. I am sincerely thankful to all the exceptional professors and mentors I've met along the way, who have profoundly shaped my understanding of mathematics, statistics, and computer science.

## Research Interests
My research lies at the intersection of multimodal learning, generative modeling, and learning theory, with a focus on AI for biomedicine and healthcare.

I am passionate about bridging elegant theoretical foundations with real-world impact, aiming to build AI systems that are efficient, interpretable, and clinically meaningful. My long-term academic goal is to harness the power of AI for cancer treatment. If you’re interested in potential collaborations or share similar research interests, please feel free to reach out.
