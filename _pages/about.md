I am a first-year PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/) (ECE) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC), advised by Prof. [Minh Do](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/minhdo). Prior to joining UIUC, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a double major in Decision Analytics from the University of Hong Kong. 

I am deeply grateful to Prof. [Xiaoming Yuan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NleHkdYAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Lequan YU](https://yulequan.github.io/) for introducing me to research and providing guidance during my undergraduate studies. Additionally, I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Justin Wan](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jwlwan/) at the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo. I am sincerely thankful to all the exceptional professors and mentors I've met along the way, who have profoundly shaped my understanding of mathematics, statistics, and computer science.

## Research Interests
I'm interested in AI for medicine/healthcare, Trustworthy AI, machine learning theory, and world model.

I am passionate about bridging elegant theoretical work with practical applications, particularly in the field of healthcare and medicine. Please feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations.
